Current download speed (MB/s)
Current upload speed (MB/s)
Constantly monitors connection status
Logs every speed reading
Logs every connection drop or error with date/time stamps

The moment Nmon detects a problem – a disconnect, packet loss, anything – it instantly logs it and flashes a bright red background so you can’t miss it.The idea is simple: leave Nmon running on the machine that’s having Internet troubles. It quietly checks the connection non-stop, building a complete history of what’s going wrong and when. When you need to escalate to your ISP, just open the data sheet – every dropout and speed dip is there in black and white, timestamped and undeniable.
